âœ… Ensure varietyâ€Š-â€ŠPrevents repetitive meal choices by tracking history.
âœ… Eat healthierâ€Š-â€ŠOptimizes meals for nutritional balance.
âœ… Reduce wasteâ€Š-â€ŠGenerates efficient grocery lists with only necessary ingredients.
âœ… Make meal planning effortlessâ€Š-â€ŠHandles everything from meal selection to grocery organization.

Busy professionals who don't have time to plan meals daily.
Health-conscious individuals who want well-balanced meal suggestions.
Families looking for variety and structure in their meals.
Anyone who wants an effortless, AI-powered way to plan meals.

Implementation
App Workflow
AI Agents Architecture
1. Top-Level Supervisor (Orchestrator)
Overview
The Top-Level Supervisor orchestrates the entire workflow, ensuring data consistency, correctness, and proper execution of all subsystems.
Name: Top-Level Supervisor
Role: Manages the full workflow and ensures consistency
Supervised Components: Meal Checker Supervisor, Meal Generator Supervisor, Meal Optimization Supervisor, Meal Pusher Supervisor

---

2. Supervisors (Workflow Managers)
Each supervisor oversees a key process within the meal planning pipeline.
Meal Checker Supervisor
Role: Ensures meal variety by retrieving past meals
Functionality: Fetches meals from the database that haven't been shown in 2 weeks

Meal Generator Supervisor
Role: Creates new meal plans when required
Functionality: Generates vegetarian meals using the Personal Chef agent and stores them in Neo4j

Meal Optimization Supervisor
Role: Optimizes meal ingredients and grocery lists
Functionality: Adjusts ingredients, removes duplicates, and ensures balanced meals

Meal Pusher Supervisor
Role: Stores finalized meal plans into the database
Functionality: Ensures meals are correctly stored and linked to appropriate ingredients

---

3. Agents (Task Executors)
Agents handle specific task execution under their respective supervisors.
Meal CheckerÂ Agent
Role: Retrieves and verifies meal history
Tools Used: get_and_update_old_meals
Functionality: Fetches past meal plans and filters options for variety

Personal ChefÂ Agent
Role: Generates new meal plans if needed
Tools Used: get_all_meals, TavilySearchResults
Functionality: Creates vegetarian meal plans with structured JSON output

Meal Optimizer Agent
Role: Adjusts ingredients and minimizes waste
Tools Used: optimize_ingredients_tool
Functionality: Refines meal plans for ingredient efficiency and cost-effectiveness

Meal PusherÂ Agent
Role: Saves finalized meals to Neo4j
Tools Used: create_meal_graph, update_db
Functionality: Ensures structured storage of meal plans

---

4. Tools (Supportive Functions)
Each agent uses specialized tools for data retrieval, optimization, and storage.
get_and_update_old_meals â†’ Retrieves meals from the database (Used by Meal Checker Agent)
TavilySearchResults â†’ Searches external sources for new meals (Used by Personal Chef Agent)
optimize_ingredients_tool â†’ Reduces redundant ingredients in grocery list (Used by Meal Optimizer Agent)
create_meal_graph â†’ Stores new meals and their ingredients (Used by Meal Pusher Agent)
update_db â†’ Updates database with finalized meal plans (Used by Meal Pusher Agent)

User Interface
Tech StackÂ Used
This system leverages AI, databases, and automation frameworks to ensure seamless meal planning. Below is a breakdown of the key technologies used:
Programming Language: Python
AI Framework: LangChain (LangGraph, LangChain-Anthropic)
LLM Models: Claude (Anthropic)
Database: Neo4j (Graph Database)
Search API: Tavily Search (for retrieving external meal data)
UI: Streamlit (for UI), REST APIs

This tech stack enables efficient query processing, AI-driven decision-making, structured meal storage, and smooth deployment.
Hierarchal Agent Architecture
Organization:
Hierarchical agents are structured like a pyramid, with a top-level agent (or agents) overseeing and directing the actions of lower-level agents.

Coordination and Supervision:
Higher-level agents make strategic decisions and delegate tasks to lower-level agents, while lower-level agents execute those tasks and provide feedback.

Benefits:
Scalability: Hierarchical structures allow for the creation of complex systems by breaking down large problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
Efficiency: By delegating tasks, agents can focus on their specific areas of expertise, leading to faster and more efficient problem-solving.
Intelligence: The ability of higher-level agents to make strategic decisions and coordinate the actions of lower-level agents enhances the overall intelligence of the system.

Why Use Neo4j for Meal Planning and Optimization?
The Graph-Based Approach to MealÂ Planning
Neo4j excels at representing relationships, making it ideal for meal planning where ingredients are interconnected through meals, dietary restrictions, and nutritional values. Each node in the graph can represent an ingredient, a meal, or a user, with relationships signifying ingredient usage, compatibility, or preference.
By structuring meal data as a graph, we can perform relationship-based optimizations such as:
Minimizing ingredient waste by identifying commonly used ingredients across multiple meals.
Recommending alternative meals based on available ingredients.
Enhancing personalization by mapping user preferences to meal clusters

Cardinality Analysis for Ingredient Optimization
Cardinality analysis refers to understanding the frequency and relationships of ingredients across different meals. In Neo4j, this can be used to:
Identify highly connected ingredients that appear frequently across multiple meal recipes.
Optimize grocery lists by prioritizing versatile ingredients that reduce waste.
Suggest substitutes for missing ingredients by analyzing alternative connections within the ingredient network.

For example, if a user frequently selects meals containing tomatoes, Neo4j can suggest recipes where tomatoes can be substituted with similar ingredients like bell peppers or zucchini to avoid redundancy.
KNN Clustering for Meal Personalization
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering is a powerful technique for grouping meals based on shared ingredients, nutritional profiles, or user preferences. In Neo4j, we can apply KNN clustering to:
Group meals based on ingredient similarity to recommend balanced meal plans.
Personalize meal suggestions based on past user selections.
Optimize diet plans by ensuring meals within a cluster meet specific nutritional criteria.

For instance, if a user prefers high-protein meals, KNN clustering can identify meals that contain similar protein-rich ingredients such as chicken, beans, and tofu, ensuring variety while maintaining the desired macronutrient balance.
Real-World Impact
By integrating Neo4j with AI-powered meal planning systems, we can achieve:
Efficient grocery shopping by predicting optimal ingredient usage.
Personalized meal recommendations based on dietary goals.
Reduction in food waste through intelligent ingredient substitution.
Dynamic meal generation that adapts to user preferences and available ingredients

Conclusion
By leveraging a Hierarchal-agent architecture, this system ensures efficient, structured, and scalable meal planning. The Top-Level Supervisor orchestrates workflows, supervisors oversee major processes, agents execute granular tasks, and tools enhance automation.
This AI-powered meal planning approach enhances efficiency, reduces redundancy, and ensures meal variety, making it a robust solution for dietary management. ðŸš€
